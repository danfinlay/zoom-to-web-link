# Zoom to Web Link

Zoom on mac has proven to be insecure, and their team demonstrated a strong inclination to avoid good security, and so the security conscious have probably uninstalled zoom.

But sometimes you need to join a zoom meeting. Fortunately, zoom has a web client. Unfortunately, zoom invite links make you try to install the application like three times before letting you join via the web client.

Enter: Zoom web link converter.

With a simple command `zoom YOUR_ZOOM_LINK`, this utility will spit out a link that you can paste in your browser to instantly join the web session, without installing any of their native applications.

Just install with npm using `npm install -g zoom-to-web-link` and then you can `zoom YOUR_WEB_LINK` away!
